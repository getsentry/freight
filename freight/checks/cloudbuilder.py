    """Track progress of builds created by Google Cloud Container Builder
    Jira ticket: OPS-111

    Add a Freight Check alongside the GitHub check that will:
    1) Print the "waiting for build yadda yadda <link to build>"
    2) Error if the build is not found, just like the GitHub check.
    3) Exit cleanly if the build for the repo+sha is successful.
    4) Print a sensible (50 lines to start) amount of the log if the build fails.

    Raises:
        CheckPending -- exception to raise if build status is in progress
        CheckFailed -- exception to raise when check for build status fails
